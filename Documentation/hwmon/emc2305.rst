Description
-----------

The SMSC / Microchip EMC2305 is a fan controller for up to 5 fans.
The EMC2303 has the same functionality but supports only up to 3 fans.

The EMC2302 supports 2 fans and the EMC2301 1 fan. These chips support less
possible I2C addresses.

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM.
The driver supports the RPM based PWM control to keep a fan at a desired speed.
To enable this function for a fan, write 3 to pwm<num>_enable and the desired
fan speed to fan<num>_target.
